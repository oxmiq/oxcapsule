# OxCapsule v0.5.170 - release September 16 2026
This release adds QOL updates to capsule streaming, agent and model serving.

You may update your OxCapsule clients with the command `capsule update`.

## 🐕‍🦺 Serve
 - `capsule serve model remove` reports reason for failure
 - Default model renamed from glm-5.2 to GLM-Large
## 🤖 Agent
 - Chat pane knows which spec you're editing and forks catalog specs into drafts
 - modify_spec refuses catalog names, points to create_spec(template_from=...)
 - New specs-listing route for the dashboard's saved-draft picker
 - Nested spec edits no longer drop sibling keys
## 📺  Streaming
- Right and middle click buttons have proper functionality

# OxCapsule v0.5.163 - release September 10 2026
This release adds elevates the experience of the serve command and fixes some bugs with announcements.

You may update your OxCapsule clients with the command `capsule update`.

## 🐕‍🦺 Serve
 - IMPORTANT: **capsule serve model key** provides a simple, convenient way to access your API Key and Endpoint for OxCapsule's self-hosted models.
 - Gateway API keys are now reused per user and expire, rather than a new key being minted for each deployment.
 - The new **capsule serve model key** shows your key and refreshes it if the gateway no longer accepts it.
 - A model deployment's connection details logs no longer include the apiKey in the logs. They now carry only endpoint and model. apiKey visibility has been replaced with the new **capsule serve model key** command.
## 🤖 Agent
 - capsule agent oxsol --serve runs the HTTP/SSE channel for the OxSol dashboard, instead of chat or one-shot mode
 - OxSol catalog spec names are now matched with exact case, so specs that previously failed to resolve now load
## 🔔 Announcements
- Fixed bug where capsule would make a network call to check for new announcements on every command.
